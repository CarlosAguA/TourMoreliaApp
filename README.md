The fundamentals of View Recycling were used in this project. Creating the source of information with an array list, an object with
the states that wanted to be shown, an adapter for populating the object within the list items, a Pager Adapter for using the 
View Pager and Fragments, and one fragment per category. This project was the sixth of the Android Basics Nanodegree by Udacity/Google.
